								The neural network collects and analyses data 24/7 and provides forecasts for various cryptocurrencies’ exchange rates. There are three types of forecasts: for 24 hours, for 48 hours and for one week. Depending on the type of forecast and the chosen cryptocurrency, the accuracy of the forecast spans within the range 
								of 70-90%.

								The analysis takes less than a second 
								and comprises the essental aspects 
								of technical analysis, such as technical analysis paterns and signal indicators.

								The program will be further enriched by introducing the remaining elements of technical analysis (Fibonacci retracement, Elliot wave theory) and fundamental analysis, which will include news analysis to determine the positve and negatve tendencies of the market.
